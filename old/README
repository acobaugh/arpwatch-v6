This is the original attempt to rewrite arpwatch in C before I decided to do it
in Perl first to work out all the details. This should compile and run, and it
will spit out ARP and NDP packets, which could easily be scraped into a database
if desired. I'm not sure that the packet filter/classification is correct, but there
you have it.
