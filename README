arpwatch-v6

A rewrite of arpwatch with support for NDP.

Other goals:
- allow monitoring multiple networks across multiple interfaces,
- arbitrary network definitions by exposing the pcap filter expressions
- a rework of the flat file database format (hostnames change over time, so don't store them)
- databases other than the .dat flat file
- external callouts for various events to allow runtime customization

Initial implementation and proof of concept will be in Perl using Net::Pcap. Final product
should use C wherever possible.
